QR Code Generator
This is a simple QR Code Generator I built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It lets you turn any text or URL into a QR code instantly — clean, fast, and easy to use.

I built this project to practice DOM manipulation, API integration, and UI design using pure JavaScript (no frameworks).

      What It Can Do
Generate a QR code from any text
Convert links into scannable QR codes
Show a smooth animation when the input is empty
Display the QR code dynamically without reloading the page
Works on different screen sizes
Built completely with vanilla JavaScript
